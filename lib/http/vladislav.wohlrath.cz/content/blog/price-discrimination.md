Introduction
------------

It is usually profitable for any kind of business to exploit any kind of predictor that
tells how much a potential customer is willing to pay for some product, and set dual price
based on this predictor.
Under normal circumstances (e.g. a retail store), the business is forced to set single price
for everybody.
Assuming that the distribution of customers' maximum price is known, setting the optimal price 
for maximum profit is an easy mathematical exercise.
But if there is any way to split this distribution into two groups which have differing distributions,
the optimal price will differ between the two groups and the total profit will always be bigger
than if there were only one price.

There are many such predictors, many of them made possible only recently using modern technology[^1].
Unsurprisingly, the biggest predictor of the maximum price an individual person is willing to pay
is the individual's wealth.
Of course, one cannot ask a customer directly for his account balance before telling them their personal
adjusted price[^2].
So businesses always resorted to secondary predictors, some of them legal and some not.
One such is if the individual is a minor, student or retired, which indicates lower wealth and thus
lower optimal price. There is nothing ethical about businesses giving student and elderly discounts.
Others, such as ethnicity, are illegal and thus much harder to exploit.

All of these

Discriminating directly based on wealth
---------------------------------------
But there is a predictor which is directly tied to wealth: risk aversion.
The basic idea, and the resolution of many discussions and paradoxes of 19-20th century economics,
is that agents are not really trying to optimize for the outcome, measured naively in money, but rather
the utility, which is an abstract concept.

All of this is of course highly impractical of course.
Also I have no idea if this has been studied before, I am not a (bleeding edge) economist :).


[^1]: Uber is giving customers prices based on how desperate they are to get a ride quickly, indicated by very low phone battery. On the other hand the drivers are getting offers based on how happy or frustrated they look on camera.
[^2]: Also made possible by modern technology. The banks are selling your account balance information to third parties and online stores (Amazon) are giving you price based on if you had a pay-check recently or are waiting for one (where in rich-poor cycle you currently are).
